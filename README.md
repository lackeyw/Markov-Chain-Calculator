# Markov-Chain-Calculator

A short program for creating and editing matrices for Discrete Time Markov Chain models. As of right now, the models supported by this program are Transient Distributions, Occupancy Times, and Cost Models. Matrices can also be multiplied or added. 

Note- This program only supports calculations over N x N matrices.
